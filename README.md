Bullet hell is a game written in c using SDL library. 
Player moves their character and avoid bullets fired by enemy bosses. Destroying one boss leeds to the next stage.
In total, there are three stages with three differen bosses with unique movement and projectile pattern.
It was my first, big project done alone and using SDL library.
